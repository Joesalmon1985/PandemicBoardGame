**What is this?**

This is a simple project I've started a long time ago to help me learn how to use vim, python and github. I've begun learning java however, and I've switched to trying to do this in java instead. When it's finished it should let somebody play the Pandemic board game as one or more of the players, and ideally with AI partners.

**What am I trying to learn?**

The basics of object orientated programming.

**The game in a nutshell**

The game takes place on a game board, and is played by 1-5 players. Each player has a hand of 0-7 cards. There are two decks, the infect and player decks. Cubes are drawn from one of 5 pools of different coloured cubes and placed on the citie. Each player has a player piece which can move from city to city on the board. Cities can also host research labs as well as players and cubes.
